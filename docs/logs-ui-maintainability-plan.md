# Logs UI — Maintainability, Clarity, and Testability Plan

**Route:** `/ui/logs`  
**Code:** `internal/server/embedui/logs.html`, `logs.css`, `logs.js`, `logs_bootstrap.js`, `embedui/logs/**`  
**Server:** `internal/server/ui_logs.go`, `internal/server/ui_handlers.go` (embed + asset routes)

This document is a **follow-on** to [`log-view-refactor-plan.md`](./log-view-refactor-plan.md). That plan drove extraction of CSS, a module folder, `derive/*`, and goja-based tests. **Most checklist items there are marked done**, but the UI is still hard to change safely because the **application shell** (`embedui/logs.js`, served as `/ui/assets/logs/main.js`) remains a large closed-over state machine. This plan focuses on **clarity** (where to edit what), **testability** (what to test without a browser), and **safe incremental refactors**.

---

## 1. Goals

| Goal | Outcome |
|------|--------|
| **Clarity** | A new contributor (human or agent) can find the right file in one step; URL ↔ disk mapping is obvious; view-mode and data-flow are documented. |
| **Testability** | Pure logic has unit tests; integration boundaries (fetch/SSE/DOM) are injectable or mockable; regressions are caught in `go test`. |
| **Change safety** | Small PRs; behavior preserved unless explicitly changed; manual checklist + automated tests per PR. |

### Non-goals (for this plan)

- Rewriting the UI in React/Vue/Svelte.
- Mandating Node/npm for the default developer loop (Go + optional tooling only unless we explicitly opt in).
- Changing public API contracts for `/api/ui/logs`, `/api/ui/logs/stream`, `/api/ui/metrics`, `/api/ui/tokens` without a dedicated “API change” phase and tests.

---

## 2. Current state (honest baseline)

**What works well**

- `embedui/logs/` holds **pure-ish** utilities: `util/*`, `parse/*`, `filters/*`, `derive/*`, `components/*`, parts of `render/*`, `transport/streaming.js`.
- **Goja tests** in `internal/server/logs_components_test.go` cover components and many `derive/*` functions.
- **HTML** is a thin shell; **CSS** is external `logs.css`.

**What still hurts**

1. **`embedui/logs.js` (~2.7k+ lines)** — Owns view-mode switching, summarized panel rebuild, structured table rows, metrics card HTML, focus/deep-link behavior, and wiring into `transport/streaming.js` via a large implicit **`ctx`**. Hard to test as a unit; easy to break edge cases.
2. **Confusing asset names** — On disk: `logs_bootstrap.js` → URL `/ui/assets/logs.js`; on disk: `logs.js` → URL `/ui/assets/logs/main.js`. Easy to edit the wrong file or search wrong symbols.
3. **`models.js` exists but is not loaded** by `logs.html` — Typedefs drift from reality; agents do not discover them.
4. **CSS** — Likely single flat file without section banners; selectors may not mirror DOM regions → hard to refactor layout safely.
5. **Transport vs. orchestration** — SSE/poll live in `transport/streaming.js` but lifecycle and “what to do with each entry” mostly live in the monolith; tests rarely span that boundary.

---

## 3. Design principles (for the refactor)

1. **Pure core, impure edges** — JSON parse, derivation, formatting, filtering = pure functions tested with goja. `fetch`, `EventSource`, `localStorage`, `document`, timers = thin adapters behind a small facade.
2. **Explicit app context** — Replace the implicit mega-`ctx` with a documented object (JSDoc in a loaded file): refs, caches, sequence state, injected `deps: { fetch, EventSource, now, storage }`.
3. **One feature → one folder** — e.g. `summarized/`, `structuredTable/`, `rawLogs/`, `metricsCards/` under `embedui/logs/`, each with `*.js` + optional `*_test`-via-goja fixtures.
4. **Stable DOM contract** — `logs.html` uses clear `id` / `data-testid` (where useful) regions documented in README; breaking selectors requires intentional change.
5. **PR-sized steps** — No big-bang; each PR moves code or adds tests without mixing large behavior changes.

---

## 4. Workstreams and phases

### Workstream A — Documentation and naming (low risk, high leverage)

**A1 — Developer map (required)**  
Add `internal/server/embedui/logs/README.md` containing:

- Table: **URL path** → **embed path** (`/ui/assets/logs/main.js` → `embedui/logs.js`, etc.).
- List of **HTTP APIs** + one **example JSON** line per endpoint (reuse shapes from `servicelogs.Entry`: `seq`, `source`, `text`, `ts`).
- **View modes** ↔ panels ↔ primary owner file (as known today; update when splits land).
- “**If you change X, also check Y**” (e.g. SSE frame shape ↔ `transport/streaming.js` ↔ `appendLine` path).

**A2 — Rename for honesty (recommended)**  
In one small PR:

- Rename `embedui/logs.js` → `embedui/logs_main.js` (or `embedui/logs/app.js`).
- Rename `embedui/logs_bootstrap.js` → `embedui/logs_entry.js` (or keep bootstrap name but align comment in `ui_handlers.go`).
- Update `//go:embed` and mux routes so **file basename matches role**.

Optional: symlink or duplicate URL for one release **only if** external tools hard-coded paths (unlikely for embedded admin UI).

**A3 — Load or import `models.js`**  
Either:

- Add `<script src=".../models.js" defer></script>` before `main`, **or**
- Move typedefs into a file that is always evaluated first and referenced from README.

---

### Workstream B — HTML clarity

**B1 — Semantic regions**  
Wrap major sections in `<section>` with stable `id` / `aria-labelledby` matching the view-mode doc:

- Status line, classic table panel, summarized panel, raw logs panel, filters, toolbar.

**B2 — Test hooks (optional but useful)**  
Add `data-testid` on: `#view-mode`, `#log-body`, `#panel-summarized`, `#raw-logs-textarea`, status container. Keeps future browser tests stable; no visual change.

**B3 — Script loading strategy (decision point)**  
**Short term:** keep ordered `defer` list; add HTML comment block mirroring the exact order and “do not reorder without …”.  
**Medium term:** switch to **native ES modules** (`type="module"`) *or* one **esbuild** bundle for `logs` only — eliminates order bugs and clarifies imports (see Workstream D).

---

### Workstream C — CSS clarity

**C1 — Section the file**  
Split `logs.css` into logical sections with banner comments:

- Base / tokens, layout, classic table, summarized cards, raw logs / toolbar, embedded overrides, motion/print optional.

**(Optional later)** Split into `logs/base.css`, `logs/summarized.css` — only if we add a trivial concat step or bundler; avoid breaking embed path count without tooling.

**C2 — Pair with DOM map**  
In README, list “DOM region → CSS section anchor” so agents do not grep-blind.

---

### Workstream D — JavaScript architecture (main effort)

**D1 — Catalog and freeze public surface of modules**  
For each file under `embedui/logs/**`, document:

- Exports on `globalThis.ClaudiaLogs.*` vs internal IIFE-only.

Goal: reduce duplicate “helper” functions in `logs_main.js`.

**D2 — Extract orchestration slices from `logs_main.js`** (multiple PRs)

Suggested order (dependencies first):

1. **View mode + layout** — `commitViewMode`, `applyViewLayout`, URL/localStorage sync → `logs/viewMode.js`.
2. **Entry pipeline** — single function `handleLogEntry(deps, state, rawEntry)` that: parse → filter → dedupe → route to summarized vs table vs textarea. Tests: fixture entries in/out.
3. **Summarized feed** — rebuild scheduling, card assembly → `render/summarizedFeed.js` + `summarized/cards/*.js` as needed.
4. **Structured table** — row builders → `render/structuredTable.js`.
5. **Metrics polling** — `fetchGatewayMetrics`, polling timer → `transport/metricsPoll.js` with injectable `fetch`.

After each extraction: **no behavior change**; move-only + wire-up.

**D3 — Formal `deps` injection**  
`streaming.js` and future poll modules accept `deps.fetch`, `deps.EventSource`, `deps.setInterval`/`clearInterval` so goja tests can stub network without Browser.

**D4 — Optional toolchain (explicit decision)**  

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Native ES modules** | No bundle step; explicit imports | Must update embed MIME + script tags; goja may need path resolution |
| **esbuild (one binary / `make` target)** | Single file to embed; clean imports | Adds dev dependency invocation in CI/Makefile |

Recommendation: finish **D2** with current global pattern if cost is lower; introduce **esbuild** only when `defer` ordering becomes painful again.

---

### Workstream E — Testing strategy

**E1 — Expand goja coverage (near-term)**

- Any new pure module from D2 gets **fixture-based tests**: input JSON arrays → snapshot or structural assertions on HTML string or intermediate model.
- Add tests for **`normalizeViewMode`** / URL persistence if extracted.
- Add tests for **dedupe / seq ordering** logic if lifted out of the monolith.

**E2 — “Golden” derivation tests**  
For `derive/*`, keep asserting stable numeric/string outputs; avoid full HTML snapshots for giant cards unless chunked.

**E3 — Go-level UI shell tests (existing pattern)**  
Continue/extend tests that assert `logs.html` contains required script URLs and ids (already noted in refactor plan).

**E4 — Optional browser smoke (later)**  
If/when CI has Chromium: a single Playwright script that opens authenticated `/ui/logs`, switches views, asserts panel visibility. Out of scope until D/B stabilize DOM hooks.

---

### Workstream F — Server alignment

**F1 — Document `servicelogs.Entry` and UI expectations**  
Short comment in `ui_logs.go` or README linking **`Entry`** fields to client parsing assumptions.

**F2 — Cors / auth / cache headers** — Leave as-is unless a test requires `Cache-Control: no-store` assertions (already used for JS).

## 5. Suggested PR sequence (agent-sized)

| # | Title | Contents |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | `ui/logs: agent README + script order comment` | README, HTML comment, link from main docs index if desired |
| 2 | `ui/logs: rename embed files to match URLs` | Rename + go:embed + mux only |
| 3 | `ui/logs: load models.js + JSDoc app state` | `models.js` + typedef for app state/deps |
| 4 | `ui/logs: section logs.css + HTML regions` | Comments + `<section>` wrappers |
| 5 | `ui/logs: extract viewMode module` | Move-only + goja tests for normalization |
| 6 | `ui/logs: extract entry pipeline` | Pure function + fixtures + wire-up |
| 7+ | `ui/logs: extract summarized / table / metrics poll` | One concern per PR |
