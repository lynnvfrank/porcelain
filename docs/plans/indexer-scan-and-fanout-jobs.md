# Plan: Scan job + fan-out list job (queue-safe initial indexing)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Doc kind** | `feature-plan` |
| **Owners / areas** | Indexer, queueing, logs UI |
| **Status** | `done` |

| **Supersedes / superseded by** | Replaces the old synchronous `EnqueueInitialScan` behavior |

## At a glance

When the indexer first scans a workspace, it shouldn't drop files or block other workspaces while one big project hogs the queue. This plan makes initial indexing reliable, fair across multiple projects, and visible per project in the operator log view, without persisting anything new to disk.

| Phase | Outcome | Status |

| [Phase 1 — Work-item model & dispatch](#phase-1--work-item-model-and-dispatch) | Queue understands scan, fan-out, and ingest as distinct work items | `done` |
| [Phase 2 — Project & flavor tagging](#phase-2--projectflavor-tagging-and-discovery-reporting) | Discovery summaries break down per project + flavor, not one global flood | `done` |
| [Phase 3 — Scan / fan-out & fair-share](#phase-3--scanjob-fanoutlistjob-fair-share-replace-enqueueinitialscan) | Bounded fan-out with a fair share of bulk capacity per workspace | `done` |
| [Phase 4 — Priority tiers & watchers](#phase-4--priority-tiers-and-watchers) | File edits jump ahead of bulk indexing | `done` |
| [Phase 5 — Operator UI per scope](#phase-5--operator-ui-website--desktop) | One summarized log card per project + flavor in `/ui/logs` | `active` |

## Replace `EnqueueInitialScan`

**`EnqueueInitialScan` is removed** as implemented today (synchronous walk + per-file `Enqueue` loop). Initial indexing is **only** driven by the new queued work:

1. Schedule **one `ScanJob`** (or equivalent entry) instead of calling `EnqueueInitialScan`.
2. `ScanJob` produces candidates and enqueues **`FanoutListJob`(s)** — never bulk-enqueues ingest jobs inline.

Optionally keep a **thin API** with a new name (e.g. `ScheduleInitialScan`) whose **sole** responsibility is to `Enqueue(ScanJob{...})` once config/matchers are ready, for `cmd/chimera-indexerer` and tests. No code path should retain the old “walk entire tree and flood the queue” behavior.

---

## Implementation status

**Last updated:** includes **scan output interleaving** (round-robin by `(ingest_project, flavor_id)` before fan-out sharding) — `interleaveTaggedCandidatesByScope` in `internal/indexer/scan_fanout.go` (see [Scan candidate ordering](#scan-candidate-ordering-multi-scope-interleaving)).

### Summary

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| `WorkItem` (`WorkIngest`, `WorkScan`, `WorkFanoutList`) + ingest `Job` payload | **Done** — `internal/indexer/work.go` |
| **Priority queue** (tiers 1–3, dequeue prefers higher tier; ingest dedup + **tier upgrade** when re-enqueued at higher tier) | **Done** — `internal/indexer/queue.go` |
| `ScheduleInitialScan` / removal of `EnqueueInitialScan` flood | **Done** — `internal/indexer/indexer.go`, `cmd/chimera-indexer/main.go` |
| **Scan job:** inventory → walk → `TaggedCandidate` → chunked `FanoutListJob` | **Done** — `internal/indexer/scan_fanout.go` |
| **Scan output interleaving** (multi-workspace balance) | **Done** — before `enqueueFanoutWork`, candidates are **round-robined** across distinct `ScopeKey(project, flavor)` (sorted keys each round); **within** each scope, walk order is kept. Single-scope configs return the list unchanged. See [`interleaveTaggedCandidatesByScope`](#scan-candidate-ordering-multi-scope-interleaving). |
| **Fair-share:** `per_scope_fanout_budget`, `pending_bulk_by_scope`, remainder fan-out | **Done** — same; `N` = distinct scope keys from **walk-time skips (per-path `IngestHeaders`) ∪ candidates** |
| **Config** `queue_fanout_high_water_mark_percent` (default 75) | **Done** — `internal/indexer/config.go`, `config/indexer.example.yaml` |
| **Watchers:** Write → tier 2, Create → tier 3 (debounced max tier) | **Done** — `internal/indexer/debounce.go`, `internal/indexer/indexer.go` |
| `initial_scan_complete` | **Phased behaviour implemented:** set after scan completes and fan-out jobs are **queued** (not after all ingests finish). See `initial_scan_completed` in `internal/indexer/observation.go` / `scan_fanout.go`. |
| **Discovery logs** | **Per-scope:** `indexer.discovery.summary.scope` (+ `rel_paths`, `paths_truncated`, `path_sample_count`); scan scheduling budget: `indexer.scan.complete`. Global `indexer.discovery.summary` helper exists in `ops_events.go` but **initial scan no longer emits it** (only scoped summaries + scan complete). |
| **Queue observability** | `indexer.queue.snapshot` includes `queue_depth_bulk`, `queue_depth_write`, `queue_depth_interactive` plus total `queue_depth`. |
| **Embed UI** | **Partial:** `indexerPresent.js` prose for `indexer.discovery.summary.scope` and `indexer.scan.complete`; `indexerMetrics.js` minor rollup tweak. **Not verified:** every summarized/story/rollup mode shows a full **card-per-scope** when `N > 1`. |
| **Per-indexer live status in summarized logs** | **Not done** — spec in [Per-indexer live status (summarized logs)](#per-indexer-live-status-summarized-logs); tracked as **[Phase 7](#phase-7--per-indexer-summarized-log-status-planned)**. |
| **Desktop parity** | **Manual** smoke-test only (same gateway embed as web); **not** automated. |
| **Tests** | **Partial:** unit tests for **budget formula**, **priority dequeue**, **tier upgrade** (`queue_test.go`, `scan_fanout_test.go`), **interleave by scope** (`TestInterleaveTaggedCandidatesByScope_*` in `scan_fanout_test.go`); integration tests updated for `ScheduleInitialScan`. **Missing vs plan:** explicit integration tests for **queue-full during fan-out**, **remainder chains under contention**, **multi-scope starvation**. |
| **Phase 6 (optional)** | **Not done:** `indexer.scope.progress`, formal dedup policy doc beyond upgrade behaviour, `fsnotify.Remove` / corpus delete. |
| **Remainder when queue physically full** | **Warn / possible loss** if re-enqueue of remainder `FanoutListJob` fails — **no** durable retry loop (plan flagged this risk). |

### Phase checklist (detail)

See [Implementation order (phased)](#implementation-order-phased) — each phase table below includes a **Status** column.

---

## Purpose

Avoid **bounded-queue loss** during initial indexing by splitting work into:

1. **Scan job** — Walk configured tree(s), apply ignores/binary/size rules (same inputs as today’s `Walk`), output a **deduped candidate list** (in memory). Does **not** push one `Job` per file onto the bounded queue.
2. **Fan-out / list job** — Holds a slice of `Candidate` (or equivalent paths). When a worker runs it, it **enqueues normal single-file ingest jobs** until a **per–project+flavor fair-share high-water mark** is reached (see [Fair-share fan-out HWM](#fair-share-fan-out-hwm)), then **enqueues another list job** with the **remainder** of the slice. Repeat until the remainder is empty.

No **new** durable storage: lists live in **queued job payloads** (process memory) until workers drain them. Same constraints as today: if the process crashes before a remainder list job runs, that slice is lost unless you add persistence later.

---

## Scan candidate ordering (multi-scope interleaving)

**Implemented** in `internal/indexer/scan_fanout.go` as `interleaveTaggedCandidatesByScope`, called from `runScanJob` immediately after the per-root walk has built `all []TaggedCandidate` and **before** **`scopeSet` / `n_scopes` discovery logging / `enqueueFanoutWork`**.

**Why:** With several **roots** in YAML order, the raw list was often **front-loaded** with files from the first workspace(s), so bulk fan-out and **`runFanoutList`’s FIFO head** looked like “one project+flavor forever” in logs and scheduling even though fair-share existed later.

**Behavior:**

- Bucket candidates by `ScopeKey(project, flavor)` (same strings as **`TaggedCandidate.Project` / `Flavor`** from `IngestHeaders`).
- Emit a **new** slice by **round-robin**: repeatedly take the **next** candidate from each non-empty bucket in **sorted scope-key order** (deterministic), until empty.
- **Preserves relative order within each scope** (per-bucket order is still the walk order for that scope).
- **No-op:** if there are **0 or 1** distinct scope keys, the original `all` slice is returned unchanged (no extra cost for single-workspace configs).

Fan-out **4096-candidate shards** are then taken from this **interleaved** list, so each shard tends to **mix** scopes instead of mirroring strict root concatenation.

---

## How the current code actually behaves (alignment check)

> **Note:** This table described **pre-migration** behaviour for planning. After implementation, see **[Implementation status](#implementation-status)** for what ships now.

| Topic | Reality today |
|--------|----------------|
| **`EnqueueInitialScan` (current)** | A **synchronous function**, not a queued job. It calls `Walk` → gets `[]Candidate` → loops `queue.Enqueue(Job{...})` per candidate. **This API goes away** in favor of `ScanJob` + `FanoutListJob` (see above). |
| **What a `Job` is** | Single shape: one file (`Root`, `RelPath`, `AbsPath`). Every dequeued item goes to `processJob` → `ingestOne` (gateway ingest). |
| **Queue** | In-process **FIFO** slice + pending **dedup set** by `Job.Key()` (root id + rel path). **No priority today.** After migration: **tiered dequeuing** (see [Priority rules](#priority-rules-bulk-vs-interactive)); full queue → `Enqueue` returns false → **drops** still possible unless backpressure retries are implemented. |
| **Watch path** | `RunWatchers` debounces fs events and calls the **same** `Enqueue` for **one file** at a time. Same queue as initial scan. |
| **Corpus inventory** | `loadRemoteCorpusInventory` runs **before** the walk in today’s `EnqueueInitialScan`; after migration it runs **inside `ScanJob`** before `Walk`. Ingest skips still use `remoteInv` + sync state **inside** `ingestOne`. |

**Misalignment to avoid:** Treating “initial scan” as if it were already a queue job — it isn’t. The **overload** happens because the scan loop tries to enqueue **all** candidates at once into a **fixed-capacity** queue.

---

## Target architecture (work kinds + priority)

Introduce a **discriminated union** (or separate types + switch) for “work items” the worker pool processes, each carrying a **priority tier** (see [Priority rules](#priority-rules-bulk-vs-interactive)):

### Kind A — `IngestJob` (current behavior)

- Fields: `Root`, `RelPath`, `AbsPath` (today’s `Job`), plus **`priority` tier** (**1** from fan-out, **2** / **3** from watchers — see priority table).
- Handler: existing `processJob` → `ingestOne` (priority does not change ingest semantics, only scheduling).

### Kind B — `ScanJob` (new)

- **Priority:** **Tier 1** (bulk).
- **Inputs:** Same conceptual inputs as today’s per-root scan: `Root` (or list of roots), `IgnoreExtra`/matcher inputs from `Resolved`, `MaxFileBytes`, binary-detection knobs. Optionally a flag “which roots” if you allow partial scans.
- **Behavior:** Run `loadRemoteCorpusInventory` if appropriate (same ordering as today — before producing candidates). For each root: build `Matcher`, call `Walk(root, WalkOptions{...})`, aggregate `[]Candidate`. **Tag each candidate** with **resolved `project` + `flavor`** via `IngestHeaders(root, relPath)` (see [Project + flavor aware scans and reporting](#project--flavor-aware-scans-and-reporting)). **Dedup** candidates across roots if overlapping paths are possible (policy TBD). **Do not** enqueue ingest jobs here. **Shipped:** after aggregation, `interleaveTaggedCandidatesByScope` reorders the candidate list for **multi-workspace balance** (see [Scan candidate ordering](#scan-candidate-ordering-multi-scope-interleaving)).
- **Output:** Emit **per–project-flavor discovery reports** (summary + file list per scope). Enqueue **one or more** `FanoutListJob` (**tier 1**) whose payloads are **4096-candidate chunks** of the **interleaved** list (scope metadata remains on each row; **not** “one FanoutListJob per scope”). Remainder `FanoutListJob`s are also **tier 1**.

### Kind C — `FanoutListJob` (new)

- **Priority:** **Tier 1** (bulk).
- **Payload:** `candidates []Candidate` (each tagged with **project + flavor**), or scope-keyed slices; plus optional metadata (e.g. `generation` for logging). **Shipped:** scan-stage **interleaving** (see [Scan candidate ordering](#scan-candidate-ordering-multi-scope-interleaving)) means each payload slice is usually a **mix** of scopes rather than one root’s contiguous block (still a **single** slice per job — fair-share HWM applies per **row’s** scope when enqueueing ingests).
- **Behavior (single worker execution):** Use **[Fair-share fan-out HWM](#fair-share-fan-out-hwm)** — **not** a single global `queue.Len() >= 75% * cap` for one scope (that would let one project+flavor monopolize the bulk slice and starve others). While iterating `candidates` for this job’s scope:
  - If **this scope’s** pending bulk ingest count would exceed its `per_scope_fanout_budget`, **stop**; **enqueue** another `FanoutListJob` with the **remaining** slice; **return**.
  - Else: try `Enqueue(IngestJob{..., tier: 1, scope: …})`. On success, bump **per-scope pending** counter for bulk tier-1 ingests. If **`Enqueue` fails** (queue physically full): remainder → new `FanoutListJob` as today.
  - When a bulk `IngestJob` is **dequeued** for processing, **decrement** that scope’s pending counter (or equivalent lifecycle hook).
- If list exhausted: done (no further list job).

**Recursive remainder:** Explicitly supported: each remainder is a **new** `FanoutListJob` on the queue, so workers eventually drain without requiring disk.

---

## Fair-share fan-out HWM

A **global** rule such as “stop when `queue.Len() >= 0.75 * queue_cap`” during fan-out would allow **one** project+flavor’s bulk work to consume almost the entire **bulk headroom**, so **other** scopes’ fan-outs (and user embedding traffic on those collections) see an **empty or stalled queue** for a long time.

Instead:

### Formula

Let:

- `cap` = `queue.Cap()` (configured `queue_depth`),
- `p` = fan-out high-water **fraction** (default **0.75**, configurable e.g. `queue_fanout_high_water_mark_percent`),
- `N` = **number of distinct project+flavor buckets** in play for this indexer run (see below).

**Per-scope bulk fan-out budget** (max pending **tier-1 bulk ingest** jobs **from fan-out** attributed to one `(project, flavor)` before that scope’s `FanoutListJob` yields and enqueues a remainder):

```text
per_scope_fanout_budget = floor(cap * p / max(N, 1))
```

- **`N = 1`:** `per_scope_fanout_budget = floor(cap * p)` — same total bulk headroom as a naive global 75% for a single-scope config; remainder recursion happens **more often** only in the sense that yielding is per-scope (acceptable tradeoff).
- **`N > 1`:** Each scope may hold up to **an equal share** of the **global** `cap * p` “bulk reservation,” so **every** active project+flavor can always make forward progress enqueueing bulk work while multiple scopes are busy.

### Defining `N`

Pick one policy (document in code):

- `N` = count of **distinct `(ingest_project, flavor_id)`** keys appearing in the **ScanJob** candidate set after tagging; or
- `N` = `DistinctIndexerTargetKeys`-style count from resolved config + roots (may slightly over-count if some keys have zero files).

### Accounting

Maintain `pending_bulk_by_scope[(project, flavor)]` (or atomic map) **incremented** when a tier-1 bulk `IngestJob` from fan-out is **successfully enqueued**, **decremented** when that job is **dequeued** for `processJob` (or when dropped — define consistency). **FanoutListJob** for scope S compares `pending_bulk_by_scope[S]` (after hypothetical enqueue) to `per_scope_fanout_budget`.

**Interaction with interactive tiers (2 / 3):** Those jobs are **not** charged to `pending_bulk_by_scope` (or use a separate pool). Priority dequeue still applies: interactive work can jump ahead; **per-scope bulk budget** only **limits bulk fan-out scheduling**, not total `queue.Len()`.

**Global hard cap:** If **`Enqueue` fails** because the **physical** queue is full, remainder fan-out behavior is unchanged — backpressure still applies.

---

## Project + flavor aware scans and reporting

Indexer YAML already binds each `Root` to `Scope` (and `GlobOverrides` refine **project / flavor / workspace** per **relative path**). Today ingest resolves headers via **`Resolved.scopeForRootPath` / `IngestHeaders`** at `ingestOne` time only. **This plan requires moving that resolution earlier** so discovery and reporting are **project + flavor aware**.

### Scan and candidate tagging

- For **every** candidate produced by `Walk`, compute `(project, flavor)` (and optionally `workspace_id`) using the **same** rules as today’s ingest: `mergeScopeFragment(DefaultScope, root.Scope)` plus `GlobOverrides` matched on `relPath` — i.e. reuse `IngestHeaders(root, relPath)` (or `scopeForRootPath`) when building or partitioning the candidate list.
- `Candidate` (or successor struct) should carry `ScopeFragment` or resolved **`project` / `flavor`** strings so `FanoutListJob` payloads and `indexer.discovery.summary` (or replacement events) can be attributed correctly.
- **Dedup** keys for ingest remain **root id + rel path**; **metrics buckets** are keyed by `(project, flavor)` (or a stable `indexer_target_key` string shared with gateway logs).

### Summary report (what operators see)

Replace the **single global** `indexer.discovery.summary` with **per–project-flavor reports** (one structured log event per scope, or one parent event with nested slices — choose based on log size limits):

Each report **must** include:

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `ingest_project` / `flavor_id` (or equivalent) | Resolved scope for this bucket (same strings sent as `X-Chimera-Project` / `X-Chimera-Flavor-Id`). |
| **Summary counts** | For that scope: candidates discovered, enqueued to fan-out / ingest pipeline, skipped by queue full, walk-time skips (ignored / binary / oversize), etc. — parallel to today’s `discoveryAgg` but **scoped**. |
| `files` (or `rel_paths`) | **The list of files this scope is working through** for this scan — root-relative paths (and root id if multiple roots) that belong to that **project + flavor** after glob overrides. This is the explicit “what we are indexing” inventory for initial bulk work. |

**Operational constraints:** Very large trees can make a single log line huge. Mitigations (pick one or combine): **cap** paths logged per event with `paths_truncated: true` + `path_sample_count`, emit **chunked** `indexer.discovery.summary.part` events per scope, or provide a **DEBUG** full list and **INFO** summary-only. Document the choice.

### Fan-out and progress

- `FanoutListJob` segments should carry **scope metadata** so remainder jobs and optional **progress** logs can say **which** project+flavor backlog is draining.
- Emit `N` and `per_scope_fanout_budget` in logs when **ScanJob** completes (or at indexer start) so operators can verify [Fair-share fan-out HWM](#fair-share-fan-out-hwm).
- **Superseded / expanded by:** [Per-indexer live status](#per-indexer-live-status-summarized-logs) `indexer.scope.status` — includes `pending_bulk`-style semantics plus `queue_ingest_pending`, `queue_fanout_files_pending`, `workspace_files_total`, optional **`current` file**.
- Legacy note: periodic `indexer.scope.progress` (narrow fields only) — prefer the `indexer.scope.status` contract above for summarized logs.

---

## Operator UI: summarized logs & desktop (rough per-scope progress)

**Requirement:** Both **(1)** the **summarized log view** on the **website** — gateway-served operator UI, including `/ui/logs` in summarized / story / rollup modes — and **(2)** **reports in the desktop app** (the `chimera desktop` shell that opens the same gateway UI, e.g. `/ui/desktop` Logs or equivalent activity surfaces) must surface a **rough status** of **current project+flavor indexing progress**.

| Surface | Role |
|---------|------|
| **Web `/ui/logs`** (summarized view) | Roll up structured indexer lines into **human-readable per–project+flavor status** (not only raw JSON tail). |
| **Desktop app** | Same content path (webview → gateway): operators see the **same rough progress** in logs / desktop reports without a separate indexer-only binary UI. |

**“Rough”** means: show **which** `(ingest_project, flavor_id)` scopes are active, and **approximate** phase/backlog (e.g. *discovery*, *fan-out backlog*, *ingesting*, *caught up*) using fields from `indexer.scope.progress`, per-scope discovery summaries, `indexer.job.ingested` / skip counters, and `indexer.state` when tagged or correlated — **not** a guaranteed accurate percentage unless `discovered` vs `completed` counts are fully instrumented.

**Data path:** Indexer **stderr** → gateway `servicelogs` → `/ui/logs` SSE/poll (same for browser and desktop webview). Story/summarized layers in `internal/server/embedui/logs` (and related JS) should **parse / bucket** per-scope `msg` values so the summarized view is **useful for indexing** — align with [`logs-ui-maintainability.plan.md`](logs-ui-maintainability.plan.md) and extend rollups for `indexer.*` scope fields.

**Deliverable:** At minimum, **one summarized line or card per project+flavor** when multiple scopes run (and a sensible single-scope summary when `N = 1`).

**Gap (planned):** [Per-indexer live status](#per-indexer-live-status-summarized-logs) — workspace file totals, queue + fan-out backlog **per scope**, and **current file** surfaced in summarized logs without treating every ingest line as a global breadcrumb.

---

## Per-indexer live status (summarized logs)

Operators today **infer** state by **triangulating** multiple unstructured or global lines (`indexer.state`, coarse queue depth, ingest lines). This section defines a **contract** so **each logical indexer** (see [Indexer identity](#indexer-identity-user--project--flavor)) appears as a **first-class row** in **`/ui/logs` summarized view** with **stable counts** and a **scoped “current file”** indicator.

### Goals

For **every** active `(user/tenant dimension, ingest_project, flavor_id)` bucket (hereinafter **scope bundle**):

1. **Workspace file count** — how many files **belong** to that scope after scan rules (same notion as `candidates_discovered` for that scope on the **last completed initial scan**, with a defined policy for **watcher-added** files and **rescans**).
2. **Queue depth (scoped)** — how many **ingest-eligible paths** are **still pending** in the work queue **for that scope** (broken down **by tier optional**: bulk vs interactive).
3. **Fan-out / follow-up backlog (scoped)** — how much work is **not yet promoted** to ingest jobs: count of `FanoutListJob` payloads **waiting on the queue** that still contain rows for this scope (**file rows**, not merely “number of list jobs”; one list job can be **multi-scope** after [interleaving](#scan-candidate-ordering-multi-scope-interleaving)).
4. **Current file (scoped)** — the `rel_path` (and **`root` id**) **actively being processed** (`ingestOne` inflight **or** last dequeued ingest for UI stickiness — pick one semantics). **UX:** summarized view shows this **only inside that scope’s card/row** (“one indexer” = **one row per scope bundle**, not one global line repeated everywhere). With **multiple workers**, **at most one current file per scope** is enough for “rough” progress; if two workers process the same scope concurrently, either show **both** under the same card (rare with fair-share) or **primary worker** only — document the choice.

### Indexer identity (user + project + flavor)

| Field | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `ingest_project` | `IngestHeaders` / `X-Chimera-Project` | Same as today’s ingest. |
| `flavor_id` | `IngestHeaders` / `X-Chimera-Flavor-Id` | Same as today. |
| **User / tenant** | Gateway-attested identity on the indexer session | Prefer structured fields already logged on `FetchAndLogConfig` (e.g. `tenant_id`, `principal_id`, `user_label`) so summarized logs can **partition** “same project, different users” if applicable. If the process is **single-tenant**, identity may be **constant** for the run — still include it for **dashboard consistency**. |
| `indexer_target_key` | Stable string | Reuse `DistinctIndexerTargetKeys` / existing `indexer_key` convention where possible so gateway indexers and **RAG** identifiers align. |

All new structured events **must** repeat `ingest_project`, `flavor_id`, and **tenant/user** fields (when known) so `embedui/logs` can **bucket** without joining unrelated lines.

### Metadata and settings

| Mechanism | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **`WorkItem` / ingest payload** | Already carry scope for fan-out; **ensure** every queued `WorkIngest` can answer `ScopeKey(project, flavor)` without re-walking `IngestHeaders` (denormalize `IngestProject`, `FlavorID` on `WorkItem` for hot queue scans — optional optimization). |
| **In-process counters** | `discovered_files_by_scope` (set at end of `ScanJob`), `pending_ingest_by_scope` (inc/dec on enqueue/dequeue per `WorkIngest`), `fanout_files_queued_by_scope` (maintain when `FanoutListJob` is enqueued/processed — see [Fan-out accounting](#fan-out-accounting-for-scoped-queue-counts)). |
| **Optional config** | e.g. `scope_status_log_interval_ms` (rate-limit periodic `indexer.scope.status`), `scope_status_include_current_file` (bool; default true). |

### Fan-out accounting (for scoped queue counts)

Because `FanoutListJob` slices are often **multi-scope**, **do not** approximate “fan-out backlog = number of list jobs” globally per scope. Pick **one**:

- **A — Derive on demand (simplest):** When emitting status, **walk the bounded queue** and for each `WorkFanoutList`, count candidates per `ScopeKey`. **Cost:** O(queue cap) — acceptable for cap ~1k and infrequent logs.
- **B — Maintain counters:** On `enqueueFanoutWork`, increment `fanout_files_queued_by_scope` by per-row scope; on `runFanoutList` when moving a row to `WorkIngest` or to a **remainder** job, adjust accordingly. **Accurate** but error-prone on failure paths — add tests.

**Follow-up fan-out** remainder jobs are still `WorkFanoutList`; they count the same way until drained.

### Structured log events (for summarized / story / rollup)

Introduce at least one **high-level** periodic line (and optional **edge-triggered** updates):

| `msg` | When | Required fields (minimum) |
|-------|------|---------------------------|
| `indexer.scope.status` | Heartbeat (e.g. aligned with `indexer.queue.snapshot` or every N s) | `ingest_project`, `flavor_id`, `workspace_files_total` (or `candidates_discovered_last_scan`), `queue_ingest_pending`, `queue_fanout_files_pending`, `pending_bulk_tier1` (optional), `index_run_id`, tenant/user fields when present |
| `indexer.scope.active_file` (optional split) | On **start** of `ingestOne` for that scope (rate-limited per scope) | `rel`, `root`, `ingest_project`, `flavor_id`, `worker` (int) — **only** for UI bucketing into that scope’s card |

**Deprecation / coexistence:** Keep existing `indexer.job.upload` / `indexer.job.ingested` but **summarized view** should **prefer** `indexer.scope.status` (+ optional `active_file`) rows to render **cards**, reducing reliance on correlating naked ingest lines.

**Multi-scope active files:** With **workers > 1**, same scope could theoretically ingest two files — either emit **two `active_file` lines** in quick succession bucketing to same card, or `current_files` array capped at 2–4 — decide for log size.

### Summarized logs UI (`embedui/logs`)

| Task | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|
| **Parse** | `indexerFlatMsg` recognizes `indexer.scope.status` and `indexer.scope.active_file`. |
| **Roll up** | **One summarized row per** `(tenant_key, indexer_target_key or project+flavor)` keyed from those events; merge with `indexer.discovery.summary.scope` for initial **workspace_files_total**. |
| **Story mode** | Show progression: discovery → queued → active file → idle. |

Desktop parity follows automatically if it uses the **same gateway embed**.

### SQL database (optional)

**Use SQL when:** the gateway needs **cross-restart**, **cross-process**, or **queryable** “last known indexer status” independent of **log ring truncation** — e.g. **multiple supervised indexers**, or an **HTTP dashboard** that should not scrape logs.

**Suggested approach:**

- **Indexer remains source of telemetry** — either (**1**) continue **stderr JSON** only and have the gateway **parser** UPSERT rows, or (**2**) add `POST /v1/internal/indexer/telemetry` (or reuse **servicelogs ingestion** pipeline) with a **validated payload** `{ scope_bundle, counters, current_file, run_id, ts }`.
- **Table sketch (illustrative):** `indexer_scope_status(run_id, tenant_id, project, flavor, workspace_files, pending_ingest, pending_fanout_files, current_rel, current_root, updated_at)` with **UNIQUE** `(run_id, project, flavor, tenant_id)` or equivalent.
- **Trade-off:** Avoid **two divergent truths** — if SQL is populated, **summarized UI** can read **API → SQL** for cards while **raw logs** remain for debugging; document which is **authoritative** for numbers.

**Default recommendation:** Ship **in-process counters + `indexer.scope.status` logs** first (no DB). Add **SQL** if operators need **history** or **multi-indexer** aggregation without log loss.

### Tests

- **Unit:** counter inc/dec on enqueue/dequeue matches queue walk for **synthetic** multi-scope fan-out queues.
- **Integration:** two scopes, interleaved fan-out, assert periodic status lines show **correct** `queue_fanout_files_pending` per scope before fan-out drains.

## Startup sequence (no `EnqueueInitialScan`)

Today (`cmd/chimera-indexer/main.go`): calls `EnqueueInitialScan`, which walks and floods the queue — **removed**.

**Proposed:**

1. After gateway config is loaded and the indexer is ready to run workers, call `ScheduleInitialScan` (or inline `queue.Enqueue(ScanJob{...})`) **once** — **no** `EnqueueInitialScan`. Preference: **queue one `ScanJob`** so the filesystem walk runs as worker-handled work (or runs synchronously inside that job only), not on the main goroutine’s bulk-enqueue loop.

2. `initial_scan_complete` semantics: today `EnqueueInitialScan` sets `initialScanCompleted` after the walk. With async jobs you must define completion as either:
   - **Strict:** “Scan job finished **and** all fan-out + ingest jobs derived from that scan finished” (requires counters / wait group — more complex), or
   - **Phased:** Set “scan phase queued” after `ScanJob` completes; keep existing flag when **scan job** completes only (watch may start earlier — document behavior).

Document the choice in operator logs (`indexer.run.progress`).

---

## Queue and dedup keys

- **`IngestJob`:** Keep existing `Key()` for pending dedup (root + rel).
- **`ScanJob`:** Fixed key e.g. `"scan\x00"` + run id, or one key per scheduled scan — **must not** collide with file keys.
- **`FanoutListJob`:** Needs **unique keys** per remainder chunk (e.g. UUID or monotonic id per remainder), otherwise dedup map may incorrectly collapse distinct remainders.

Today’s `pending map[string]struct{}` assumes string keys; extend carefully.

---

## Priority rules (bulk vs interactive)

The **FIFO-only** queue cannot express these rules; implement **explicit priority** on every work item (enum or integer **priority class** stored on `Job` / `WorkItem`).

### Tier ordering (highest first)

| Tier | Name | Sources | Purpose |
|:----:|------|---------|---------|
| **3** | **Interactive — structural** | Filesystem **create** and **delete** events (and any future “corpus remove” jobs tied to delete). | Reflect adds/removals quickly so the index matches the tree. |
| **2** | **Interactive — content** | Filesystem **write** / modify events on existing files (`Write`; optionally debounced coalescing **within** this tier). | Refresh embeddings after edits without starving tier 3. |
| **1** | **Bulk / backfill** | `ScanJob`, `FanoutListJob`, and **every ingest job** those fan-outs enqueue for initial/catch-up indexing. | Large tree walks must not block interactive work. |

**Rule:** On `Dequeue`, the worker pool **must** take the **ready** item with the **maximum tier** (prefer **3** over **2** over **1**). Within the same tier, **FIFO** order is preserved.

### Mapping job kinds to tiers

| Work kind | Tier | Notes |
|-----------|:----:|-------|
| `ScanJob` | **1** | Lowest; discovery can wait behind user-driven FS activity. |
| `FanoutListJob` | **1** | Same as bulk — scheduling more ingest slots from the scan backlog. |
| `IngestJob` enqueued **from** `FanoutListJob` | **1** | Tagged bulk at enqueue time (carry priority in the ingest payload). |
| `IngestJob` enqueued **from** `RunWatchers` — **Create** | **3** | New files jump ahead of bulk. |
| `IngestJob` enqueued **from** `RunWatchers` — **Write** | **2** | Modified files beat bulk; loses to create/delete if queue contended. |
| `IngestJob` enqueued **from** `RunWatchers` — **Remove / delete** | **3** | Same tier as create if the operation is “drop indexed doc” or tombstone; if delete is not yet modeled, add `RemoveJob` / ingest-delete API **before** relying on this row (today’s watcher path focuses on **Create\|Write** — extend fsnotify handling as needed). |

### Dedup vs priority

If the **same path** is pending twice at **different** tiers (e.g. bulk ingest queued, then user saves the file), policy options:

- **Upgrade priority:** replace pending lower-tier entry with higher-tier **or** bump priority in place (requires queue structure that supports update-by-key).
- **Strict FIFO within tier only:** simpler dequeuer; may briefly duplicate work — resolve with existing ingest idempotency / sync state.

Document the chosen policy when implementing (your note: dedup details later).

### Implementation sketch

- **Option A — Three internal FIFO queues** (`bulk`, `interactive_write`, `interactive_create_delete`): `Dequeue` checks create/delete queue, then write, then bulk. **Fan-out HWM** uses **[per-scope fair-share budget](#fair-share-fan-out-hwm)** — **not** global `queue.Len() >= 0.75 * cap` for a single scope’s list job.
- **Option B — One slice + priority heap** / ordered structure: more complex; use if memory or key updates require it.

---

## Interaction with `RunWatchers`

Watchers enqueue **ingest** (and eventually **remove**) jobs with **tier ≥ 2** (see table above). **Bulk** `ScanJob` / `FanoutListJob` / fan-out **ingest** use **tier 1**.

**Interaction:** When the shared queue is **priority-aware**, file changes **preempt** bulk work in the sense that workers **drain** high-tier items first. **Fan-out** uses **[fair-share per-scope bulk budget](#fair-share-fan-out-hwm)** so no single project+flavor monopolizes bulk headroom; if **`Enqueue` fails** because the **physical** queue is at `queue_cap`, use backpressure and retry or re-enqueue with the same tier.

**Current code gap:** `RunWatchers` only arms **Create\|Write**; **delete** (tier 3) must be **added** if “remove from index” is part of the product, or the delete row in the table applies only after that exists.

**Deliverable order:** Implement **queue-safe fan-out (tier-1 bulk)** first if needed, then add **priority dequeuing** and tag watcher enqueues with **2** and **3**.

---

## What changes (code touch list)

Implement in **[Implementation order (phased)](#implementation-order-phased)** — the list below is a **flat inventory** of affected areas, not the sequence of work.

1. **`internal/indexer/queue.go` / job model:** Extend `Job` (or rename to `WorkItem`) with **kind** enum + payload structs + **`priority` tier** (1 / 2 / 3). Replace single FIFO with **priority-aware `Dequeue`** (three FIFO lanes or equivalent); `Enqueue` accepts tier. Same `Key()` dedup semantics extended so tier-upgrade rules are explicit.

2. **`processJob`:** Dispatch on kind — `Ingest` → existing path; `Scan` → walk + enqueue `FanoutListJob`; `FanoutList` → fan-out loop + possibly enqueue next `FanoutList`. Maintain `pending_bulk_by_scope` (increment on enqueue of tier-1 bulk ingest from fan-out, decrement on dequeue / drop) for [Fair-share fan-out HWM](#fair-share-fan-out-hwm).

3. **`EnqueueInitialScan`:** **Delete** the current implementation. Add `ScheduleInitialScan` (or equivalent) that **only** enqueues a `ScanJob` (and does not walk or bulk-enqueue ingests). Replace global `indexer.discovery.summary` with **per–project-flavor** discovery reports (summary counts + file list per scope) emitted from `ScanJob` — see [Project + flavor aware scans and reporting](#project--flavor-aware-scans-and-reporting).

4. **`cmd/chimera-indexer/main.go`:** Replace `EnqueueInitialScan` calls with `ScheduleInitialScan` (or direct `ScanJob` enqueue). Startup no longer uses a synchronous full-tree enqueue loop — timing of logs and when `initial_scan_completed` flips must match the chosen semantics above.

5. **Tests:** Queue full + **per-scope** fair-share HWM + remainder chaining; multi-scope configs do not allow one scope to block another’s bulk budget; `N = 1` behavior matches `floor(cap * p)` budget.

6. **Config:** Optional `queue_fanout_high_water_mark_percent` (default **75**, i.e. `p = 0.75` in [Fair-share fan-out HWM](#fair-share-fan-out-hwm)). Optional **priority** toggles if you need to disable tiering in tests.

7. **`RunWatchers`:** Pass **fsnotify op** (or derived tier) into `Enqueue` for ingest jobs; add **Remove** handling if tier-3 delete is required (may be a follow-up if API is not ready).

8. **Gateway UI / logs:** Update `embedui/logs` (summarized / story / rollup) so **[Operator UI](#operator-ui-summarized-logs--desktop-rough-per-scope-progress)** shows **rough per–project+flavor indexing progress** from structured indexer events; verify parity in **desktop** webview.

9. **Per-indexer summarized status:** Implement **[Per-indexer live status](#per-indexer-live-status-summarized-logs)** — `indexer.scope.status` (and optional `indexer.scope.active_file`), scoped queue + fan-out file counts, `workspace_files_total` per **user+project+flavor**, and `embedui` rollups (**[Phase 7](#phase-7--per-indexer-summarized-log-status-planned)**). Optional gateway **SQL** / **UPSERT API** if persistence or multi-indexer aggregation is required.

---

## Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Huge `[]Candidate` in one `ScanJob`** | Stream roots into multiple `FanoutListJob`s from scan without materializing one giant slice; or cap slice size and chain scan sub-jobs per directory. |
| **Memory** | Remainder lists duplicate slices — acceptable per product choice; watch peak RSS on large trees. |
| **Worker stuck on long fan-out** | Fan-out job should only **enqueue** (cheap) and yield; heavy work stays in **ingest** jobs. Optionally bound “max ingests scheduled per fan-out execution” (time slice). |
| **Crash mid-backlog** | Same as today — no persistence; user accepts until WAL/checkpoint added. |
| **`initial_scan_complete` / UI** | Define semantics and update any consumer expecting synchronous completion. |
| **Huge path lists in logs** | Cap, chunk, or DEBUG-only full `files` per scope; see [Project + flavor aware scans and reporting](#project--flavor-aware-scans-and-reporting). |
| **`N` or pending counters wrong** | Mis-sized fair-share budget or leaks in **per-scope pending** → unfair scheduling or premature yield; add tests and assert monotonic **pending_bulk_by_scope** under load. |
| **Scoped status counters drift from queue** | If maintaining `fanout_files_queued_by_scope` incrementally (vs queue walk), every enqueue/dequeue/remainder path must update counters — add invariant tests comparing **derived vs O(cap) scan**. |

---

## Summary feedback

- **You’re aligned** that the fix is **not** “bigger queue only” but **not flooding** the queue during discovery; **chunked fan-out with remainder jobs** matches the bounded queue without extra storage.
- **Misalignment:** Calling **`EnqueueInitialScan` a job** — it isn’t; the plan **removes** it and uses **`ScanJob` + `FanoutListJob`** so discovery and fan-out are **actual** queued work and **backpressure** applies.
- **Gap:** Current **`Job` + `processJob`** are **ingest-only**; extending them is **required**. **Priority** (tiers **1 / 2 / 3**) is **specified** in [Priority rules](#priority-rules-bulk-vs-interactive) and implemented via queue + watcher tagging.
- **Reporting:** Discovery and summaries become **per project + flavor**, each including **summary counts** and the **list of files** in scope for that scan — see [Project + flavor aware scans and reporting](#project--flavor-aware-scans-and-reporting).
- **Fair-share HWM:** Bulk fan-out uses `per_scope_fanout_budget = floor(cap * p / N)` so multiple project+flavor scopes **share** the bulk slice of the queue; `N = 1` matches the old single-scope headroom with more frequent remainder jobs — see [Fair-share fan-out HWM](#fair-share-fan-out-hwm).
- **Scan ordering:** Candidate lists are **round-robin interleaved** across `ScopeKey(project, flavor)` before fan-out so bulk work and logs are not stuck behind a single root’s contiguous prefix — see [Scan candidate ordering](#scan-candidate-ordering-multi-scope-interleaving).
- **Operator UI:** **[Summarized logs & desktop](#operator-ui-summarized-logs--desktop-rough-per-scope-progress)** must show **rough** per–project+flavor indexing progress on the **website** and in the **desktop app**.
- **Per-indexer summarized cards:** See **[Per-indexer live status](#per-indexer-live-status-summarized-logs)** and **[Phase 7](#phase-7--per-indexer-summarized-log-status-planned)** — workspace totals, scoped queue + fan-out file backlog, **current file** pinned to **that** scope’s row in summarized logs.

---

## Implementation order (phased)

Work proceeds **in phase order** unless a note says otherwise. Each phase should be **mergeable** (tests green) before starting the next.

### Phase 1 — Work-item model and dispatch

**Status: Done**

| Step | Deliverable | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1.1 | Introduce **`WorkItem` / extended `Job`**: kind enum (`Ingest`, `Scan`, `FanoutList`) and payloads. `Ingest` keeps today’s file fields. | **Done** (`work.go`; ingest fields remain `Job`) |
| 1.2 | **`Enqueue` / `Key()`:** Distinct keys for `ScanJob` and `FanoutListJob` so dedup does not collapse meta-jobs ([Queue and dedup keys](#queue-and-dedup-keys)). | **Done** (`scan\x00…`, `fanout\x00…` + monotonic id) |
| 1.3 | **`processJob`:** Dispatch on kind — `Ingest` → existing `ingestOne` path; stubs or minimal `Scan` / `FanoutList` handlers (can noop until Phase 2). | **Done** (`processWorkItem` → `runScanJob` / `runFanoutList` / `processIngestWithRetries`) |
| 1.4 | **Config:** Add `queue_fanout_high_water_mark_percent` (default **75**) for `p` in [Fair-share fan-out HWM](#fair-share-fan-out-hwm). | **Done** |

**Exit criteria:** Binary builds; existing single-kind ingest tests still pass or are updated.

---

### Phase 2 — Project+flavor tagging and discovery reporting

**Status: Done**

| Step | Deliverable | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2.1 | For each `Walk` candidate, compute `IngestHeaders(root, relPath)` and attach **project + flavor** to `Candidate` (or successor struct). | **Done** (`TaggedCandidate`) |
| 2.2 | **Compute `N`** (distinct scopes in candidate set or config — pick one policy and document). | **Done** — `N` = distinct scope keys from **candidates ∪ walk skips** (per-path headers). |
| 2.3 | Replace one-shot global discovery log with **per–project-flavor** reports: **summary counts** + `files` (with [size/truncation policy](#summary-report-what-operators-see)). | **Done** — `indexer.discovery.summary.scope` with `rel_paths` capped (**200** paths, `paths_truncated`, `path_sample_count`). |

**Exit criteria:** Structured logs prove **scoped** discovery with correct buckets on multi-root / glob-override configs.

---

### Phase 3 — `ScanJob`, `FanoutListJob`, fair-share, replace `EnqueueInitialScan`

**Status: Mostly done** (step 3.5 tests **partial**)

| Step | Deliverable | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 3.1 | **`ScanJob`:** Run `loadRemoteCorpusInventory`, `Walk` per root, aggregate tagged candidates; **interleave by scope** (round-robin) then enqueue `FanoutListJob` payload(s) — **no** per-file ingest flood. | **Done** (fan-out lists chunked to **4096** candidates per job; `interleaveTaggedCandidatesByScope`) |
| 3.2 | `pending_bulk_by_scope` + `per_scope_fanout_budget = floor(cap × p / max(N,1))`; `FanoutListJob` enqueues tier-1 **`IngestJob`s** until scope budget hit → **remainder** `FanoutListJob` ([Fair-share fan-out HWM](#fair-share-fan-out-hwm)). | **Done** |
| 3.3 | **Delete `EnqueueInitialScan`**; add `ScheduleInitialScan` that only `Enqueue(ScanJob)`. Wire `cmd/chimera-indexer` and `internal/indexer` tests. | **Done** |
| 3.4 | Define and implement `initial_scan_complete` / `indexer.run.progress` semantics ([Startup sequence](#startup-sequence-no-enqueueinitialscan)). | **Done** — **phased:** flag after scan + fan-out **enqueue**; progress logs `scan_scheduled`, `initial_scan`, `indexer.scan.complete`. |
| 3.5 | **Tests:** Queue physically full + **per-scope** fair-share + remainder chains; `N = 1` matches `floor(cap × p)` budget; multi-scope does not starve. | **Partial** — budget formula + integration `ScheduleInitialScan` covered; **missing** dedicated tests for queue-full remainder chains and multi-scope contention. |

**Exit criteria:** Large trees no longer lose bulk candidates solely due to single-scope monopolization of a global 75% cap; core indexer workflow complete for **bulk tier 1 only**.

---

### Phase 4 — Priority tiers and watchers

**Status: Done** (Remove/deferred)

| Step | Deliverable | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 4.1 | Add `priority` (1 / 2 / 3) to work items; implement **priority-aware `Dequeue`** ([Priority rules](#priority-rules-bulk-vs-interactive), [Implementation sketch](#implementation-sketch)). | **Done** (`PriorityTier`, three lanes) |
| 4.2 | Tag **`ScanJob` / `FanoutListJob` / fan-out `IngestJob`** as **tier 1**. | **Done** |
| 4.3 | **`RunWatchers`:** pass event op → **tier 2** (Write) / **tier 3** (Create); optional **Remove** later if product/API ready. | **Done** for Create/Write; `Remove` **not** implemented |
| 4.4 | **Tests:** Under load, **tier 3** dequeues before **tier 1** backlog; fair-share and `Enqueue` failure paths still behave. | **Partial** — `TestQueue_DequeuePrefersInteractiveTier` + `TestQueue_IngestTierUpgrade`; **no** dedicated test for enqueue-failure during fan-out. |

**Exit criteria:** Interactive filesystem work preempts bulk per the tier table.

---

### Phase 5 — Operator UI (website + desktop)

**Status: Partial**

| Step | Deliverable | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 5.1 | **`embedui/logs`:** Summarized / story / rollup recognizes per-scope `indexer.*` fields and shows **[rough per-scope progress](#operator-ui-summarized-logs--desktop-rough-per-scope-progress)**. | **Partial** — `indexerPresent.js` (+ `indexerFlatMsg`) handles `indexer.discovery.summary.scope` and `indexer.scan.complete`; `indexerMetrics.js` rolls scoped discovery into ignore-metrics where applicable. **Gaps:** not every summarized/story/rollup path verified for **one card per scope** when `N > 1`; `indexer.scope.status` / `active_file` (**[Phase 7](#phase-7--per-indexer-summarized-log-status-planned)**) **not implemented**. |
| 5.2 | **Desktop webview:** Smoke-test parity with web `/ui/logs` on the same gateway session. | **Not automated** — same embed as desktop; manual smoke only. |

**Exit criteria:** Operators see **one rough status per project+flavor** (when `N > 1`) in summarized view on **both** surfaces.

---

### Phase 6 — Hardening and follow-ups

**Status: Optional follow-ups** (6.1/6.3 not done; 6.2 = **code-only** tier upgrade)

| Step | Deliverable | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 6.1 | Optional `indexer.scope.progress` periodic logs for finer UI ([Fan-out and progress](#fan-out-and-progress)). | **Superseded** by planned `indexer.scope.status` in **[Phase 7](#phase-7--per-indexer-summarized-log-status-planned)** (broader fields). |
| 6.2 | **Dedup vs priority upgrade** policy ([Dedup vs priority](#dedup-vs-priority)) if races appear in production. | **Behaviour implemented** in `queue.go`; **no** separate operational runbook / ADR (still optional hardening). |
| 6.3 | **Tier 3 delete** path end-to-end if **Remove** ingest/corpus API lands ([Interaction with `RunWatchers`](#interaction-with-runwatchers)). | **Not done** |

---

### Phase 7 — Per-indexer summarized log status (planned)

**Status: Not started** — fulfills [Per-indexer live status (summarized logs)](#per-indexer-live-status-summarized-logs).

| Step | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|
| 7.1 | **`internal/indexer`:** Persist per-scope `workspace_files_total` after `ScanJob` (from discovery counts); define policy for **watcher-only** new files (**+1** heuristic vs full rescan flag). |
| 7.2 | **Queue metrics:** `pending_ingest_by_scope` (all tiers’ `WorkIngest` on queue, grouped by `ScopeKey`) via enqueue/decrement hooks or `Queue` iterator for validation tests. |
| 7.3 | **Fan-out backlog:** `queue_fanout_files_pending` per scope — [derive-on-queue-walk](#fan-out-accounting-for-scoped-queue-counts) **or** maintained counters (with tests on remainder + mixed-scope shards). |
| 7.4 | **`indexer.scope.status`:** Periodic structured log (**rate-limited**) with `ingest_project`, `flavor_id`, tenant/user fields (`tenant_id` / `user_label` when present), `workspace_files_total`, `queue_ingest_pending`, `queue_fanout_files_pending`, optional tier breakdowns, `index_run_id`. |
| 7.5 | **`indexer.scope.active_file`:** Emit when starting `ingestOne` for a path (rate-limit per scope) so summarized UI shows **current file only under that indexer’s row** (`rel`, `root`, `worker`). |
| 7.6 | **`internal/server/embedui/logs`:** Parse, prose, rollup — **one summarized card/row per scope bundle** using `indexer.scope.status` as primary spine; merge discovery lines for totals. |
| 7.7 | **Tests:** Counter invariants vs queue walk; multi-scope fan-out shard counts; summarized derive tests (goja fixtures if applicable). |
| 7.8 | **Optional — SQL:** Gateway table + ingestion path (**telemetry POST** or log consumer UPSERT) if **persistence / multi-indexer** required; avoid dual sources without documenting **authority**. |

**Exit criteria:** Summarized `/ui/logs` lists **each** indexer (**user+project+flavor**) with **workspace total**, **pending ingest**, **pending fan-out (file rows)**, and **current file** scoped to **that row** — without depending on correlating unrelated global ingest lines.

**Dependency:** Builds on Phase 3–5; can ship **after** Phase 5 partial or in parallel once `indexer.scope.status` exists.

## Handoff: notes for the next agent / things to ask the owner

This section is **intentionally explicit** so another implementer does not have to rediscover context from chat history.

### Facts another agent should assume (unless code contradicts)

| Topic | Note |
|-------|------|
| **Queue storage** | The indexer queue is **in-memory only** (`internal/indexer/queue.go`). Restart loses pending jobs; remainder `FanoutListJob` payloads are not persisted. |
| **Scope resolution** | Per-file **`project` / `flavor`** must match ingest: **`Resolved.IngestHeaders` / `scopeForRootPath`** (`internal/indexer/scope.go`). Do not invent parallel rules. |
| **`N` for fair-share** | **Implemented:** `N` is fixed for a run from the **union** of scopes seen during walk (skips + candidates). `indexer.scan.complete` logs `n_scopes` and `per_scope_fanout_budget`. |
| **Scan candidate order** | **Implemented:** `interleaveTaggedCandidatesByScope` runs after the walk, before fan-out enqueue; multi-scope configs get **round-robin** ordering by scope key (**sorted** each pass); see [Scan candidate ordering](#scan-candidate-ordering-multi-scope-interleaving). |
| **Gateway logs pipeline** | Operator UI reads indexer output via **gateway `servicelogs`** (indexer stderr tee’d in `cmd/chimera/serve.go`). New structured fields must remain **JSON-log-parseable** from that stream for `/ui/logs`. |
| **Desktop vs web** | Desktop uses the **same** gateway `/ui/logs` embed — UI work is **not** duplicate native widgets unless product asks otherwise. |
| `initial_scan_complete` | **Implemented as phased:** flips after `ScanJob` completes and `FanoutListJob` work is **queued** (see `runScanJob` / `initialScanCompleted`). `indexer.state` may show `backlog` / `uploading` while bulk ingests continue. |
| **BiFrost / Qdrant** | This plan touches `internal/indexer` and gateway **embed UI** only unless ingest APIs change; gateway **ingest** handlers are unchanged unless delete/remove scope is added in Phase 6. |

### Open decisions — **ask the owner** if not specified elsewhere

Resolved in code (see [Implementation status](#implementation-status)):

1. **`N` policy:** **Resolved** — `N` = number of distinct scope keys from **walk skips** (per-path `IngestHeaders`) **plus** tagged candidates (union). Logged as `n_scopes` on `indexer.scan.complete`.
2. **Discovery `files` list in logs:** **Resolved** — INFO `rel_paths` capped (**200**), with `paths_truncated` and `path_sample_count`.
3. **`initial_scan_complete` semantics:** **Resolved — phased:** flag flips after scan finishes and fan-out list jobs are **enqueued** (not when all bulk ingests complete).
4. **Priority vs dedup collision:** **Resolved** — **tier upgrade:** enqueueing the same ingest key at a **higher** tier **replaces** the pending lower-tier item (`internal/indexer/queue.go`).

Still open / deferred:

5. **Remove / tier 3:** `fsnotify.Remove` and corpus delete — **deferred** (watchers still **Create|Write** only for enqueue).
6. **Fair-share when interactive dominates:** If physical queue is full, remainder `FanoutListJob` re-enqueue may **fail** — currently **warn** / possible **loss**; **no** infinite retry loop (revisit if production shows starvation).

### Implementation hazards (watchlist)

- `pending_bulk_by_scope` must stay consistent across **enqueue**, **dequeue**, **failed ingest drop**, and **priority upgrade** evictions — leaks distort fair-share.
- **Multi-lane priority `Dequeue`** + `Len()` — `indexer.queue.snapshot` exposes total `queue_depth` plus `queue_depth_bulk`, `queue_depth_write`, `queue_depth_interactive`.
- **Tests:** Prefer `internal/indexer` integration-style tests with fake `GatewayClient` (patterns exist in `indexer_test.go`) before relying only on E2E.

### When to stop and ask the owner

- Changing `queue_depth` defaults or **fair-share formula** after UX promises were made.
- Adding **durable** queue persistence (SQLite, etc.) — **out of scope** for this plan; separate ADR.
- **Breaking** changes to `indexer.discovery.summary` field names without a migration window for log parsers or dashboards.
- Introducing **`indexer_scope_status` SQL** (or similar): **migration ownership**, **retention**, and whether **summarized UI** reads **logs vs DB** as **source of truth** — decide with **[Phase 7.8](#phase-7--per-indexer-summarized-log-status-planned)**.
