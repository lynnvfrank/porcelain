## At a glance

Operators create **assistants** in operator SQLite—each with a client-facing `model_id` (name + version), description, enable flag, and visibility—and attach a **routing stack**: required ordered fallback chain, optional routing-policy rules, and optional tool-router block. The gateway loads enabled assistants into an in-memory registry, exposes them on `GET /v1/models`, and resolves `POST /v1/chat/completions` per assistant id. Fresh installs start with **zero** assistants (only a routing-rule definition catalog is seeded); operators create assistants in settings. Settings cards support full CRUD, generate-from-catalog, dry-run evaluate, and scoped routing-decision logs carrying `assistant_id`.

## Operator-visible behavior

- **Assistant cards** on `/ui/settings` — list, create, edit metadata, enable/disable, delete.
- **Routing stack editors** — Fallback chain (required), routing policy YAML (toggleable), tool router models + confidence (toggleable). These configure the [chat routing pipeline](gateway-chat-routing-pipeline.md); cards do not execute routing themselves.
- **Harness modules** — Per-assistant toggles for retrieval, intent, evaluator, escalation, and workspace tools (`GET/PUT /api/ui/assistants/{id}/harness`). Workspace tools inject gateway-native file/search tools plus optional MCP sidecars when `tool_executor` is on ([Gateway MCP tool backends](gateway-mcp-tool-backends.md)). The harness card shows MCP server bind toggles and per-tool allowlists when operator SQLite defines servers; catalog rebuilds on the next chat turn after save. `max_tool_rounds` defaults to 5 and workspace policy decides whether reads or writes are permitted. Evaluator supports `single_pass` and `multi_draft`; multi-draft uses `draft_count` (default 3, capped at 8 and available fallback models) plus `synthesize_model_id`, buffers the response through synthesis and JSON evaluation, and returns one answer. Escalation accepts `{ "max_rounds":0..2, "on_fail":["re_retrieve","fallback_chain","ensemble","human"], "human_surfaces":[{"name":"…","url":"…"}], "privacy_disclosure":"…", "paste_back_delimiter":"…" }`. The human target is emitted only after internal remediation exhausts; a next user message containing the delimiter supplies external context without blocking ordinary turns. Gallery fixtures show single-pass, multi-draft, and human escalation states.
- **Generate from catalog** — Builds fallback or policy from **available** upstream models only (respects provider availability).
- **Evaluate / preview** — Dry-run policy against sample message text without sending chat.
- **Harness evaluate** — `POST /api/ui/assistants/{id}/harness/evaluate` runs stack resolution, meta-policy, and intent against a sample message, returning a redacted envelope without retrieval injection or an upstream primary completion.
- **Scoped logs** — Card expanded panel shows routing, fallback, and tool-router events for that assistant id.
- **Chat selector** — Enabled public assistants appear in `/ui/chat` model dropdown alongside upstream ids.
- **Disabled / private** — Disabled assistants hidden from catalog and rejected on chat; private assistants visible only to creating principal (single-user desktop uses empty tenant today).

## System behavior and contracts

**Invariants**

- Assistants persist in **operator SQLite** (`assistants` and attachment tables); not in `chimera.yaml` for new config.
- Client protocol unchanged: callers send one `model` string on chat/completions (wire details: [`configuration.md`](../configuration.md#chat-completions-client-contract)).
- Each assistant compiles routing policy into `routing.InMemoryPolicy` at registry reload.
- Fallback walk skips unavailable models (provider availability), quota/context limits, and retriable upstream errors.
- Structured logs include `assistant_id` on routing resolution and fallback attempts (legacy log fields may still carry `virtual_model_id` during transition).
- RAG remains **gateway-global** for enablement (`search.enabled`); the per-assistant **retrieval** harness module can disable injection or override retrieval knobs for that turn. Empty retrieval config inherits gateway RAG top-k and score floor.
- Evaluator failures fail open to the primary response. `immediate` preserves live SSE; gated policies buffer the primary, evaluate it, and can escalate before delivering one response.

**Decisions**

| Topic | Decision |
|-------|----------|
| Model id format | `{Name}-{Version}` stored unique per tenant |
| Bootstrap | Seed routing-rule catalog only; **no** YAML import into SQLite |
| Fallback | Required non-empty chain; generate uses available catalog only |
| Routing rules | Shared policy YAML body per assistant; first matching `when.min_message_chars` wins |
| Tool router | Optional; `router_models[]`, `confidence_threshold`, enable flag |
| Reload | Registry refresh after CRUD via assistant registry reload |
| Direct upstream | Clients may send any upstream `provider/model` id when not using an assistant |

**Identity / auth / scoping**

- Rows scoped by `tenant_id` (empty string default desktop).
- `created_by_principal_id` tracks owner for `private` visibility.
- Chat resolves assistant by exact `model_id` string match.

**Persistence**

- Migrations under `migrations/chimera-gateway/operator/` (assistant tables; rename migration from legacy `virtual_models`).
- Attachments: fallback chain JSON, routing policy YAML blob, tool-router fields on assistant row.

## Verification

```bash
go test ./chimera/chimera-gateway/internal/server/ -run Assistant
go test ./chimera/chimera-gateway/internal/operatorstore/ -run Assistant
go test ./chimera/chimera-gateway/internal/server/adminui/embed/embedui_test -run Assistant
```

Manual: create two assistants with different fallback chains; chat with each; confirm distinct upstream models and scoped log panels.

## Out of scope and known gaps

- Shared routing-rule definition catalog (reusable named rules across assistants) — assistant stores policy YAML directly today.
- Rate-limit policy per assistant.
