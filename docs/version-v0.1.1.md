## At a glance

Cut the size of upstream tool payloads, give operators an opinionated routing list in the admin UI, persist gateway metrics on disk, and refuse traffic that would blow past per-provider request and token limits. The headline outcome: chats stop carrying every available tool every turn, and the gateway respects each provider's daily and per-minute caps.

**Product:** chimera-gateway — OpenAI-compatible LLM gateway with **BiFrost** upstream.

**Audience:** Implementing agents should treat this doc as the **source of truth** for *what* v0.1.1 delivers, *constraints*, *order of work*, and *how to verify*.

**Implementation snapshot:** **G1** and **G6** are **Done**. **G5** is **Partial** (quota admission + metrics UI + **virtual-model 413 fallback** **shipped**; **413 cooldown timers** not). **G2–G4** (tool slimming, router config + admin, transformer pipeline) are **Done** in code: `internal/transform` tool-router, `routing.router_models` + `routing.tool_router` in `chimera.yaml`, admin panel **Router models (tool slimming)**, and `POST /v1/chat/completions` wiring in `internal/server/server.go`. Details in the goals table, §3.3, §3.1 / §3.5 (transformer design), §3.6–3.7, and §4–§7.

## 1. Goals (what v0.1.1 implements)


| #   | Status   | Goal                                             | User-visible outcome                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| G1  | **Done** | **Local (Ollama) models in free-tier filtering** | When free-tier filtering is on, **Ollama** models from the live catalog can appear in merged model listing and in **generated** routing/fallback (same intersection rules as other providers).                                                                                                                                                       |
| G2  | **Done** | **Smaller upstream `tools` payloads**            | When the tool-router is enabled and `tools` is present, the gateway **replaces** `tools` with the subset whose router-assigned **confidence ≥ threshold** before normal routing/upstream (fail-open keeps all tools on any router error).                                                                                                                                                                       |
| G3  | **Done** | **Configurable router model + admin visibility** | Operators set ordered `routing.router_models` and `routing.tool_router` in `chimera.yaml`; admin **Routing & fallback** shows the list, threshold, enable flag, **last router call** (model, time, error), and **catalog-missing** ids after save.                                                                                                                                                      |
| G4  | **Done** | **Transformer pipeline on chat completions**     | `POST /v1/chat/completions` runs the **tool-router transformer** first (see §3.5.1), then the existing virtual-model / direct proxy path unchanged.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| G5  | **Partial** | **413-aware behavior with cooldowns**            | **Shipped:** **Quota admission** (same as before). **Virtual Chimera:** on upstream **HTTP 413**, the gateway **records metrics** for that attempt then walks `routing.fallback_chain` from the policy-aligned start, **skipping any model id that already returned 413** on the same request, and retries the **same** client payload on the next candidate (same behavior class as 429/5xx fallback). **Direct** upstream id: **413** is returned to the client (**no** fallback). **Not shipped:** time-based **413 cooldown** / backoff config, TPM vs payload classification (§3.3). |
| G6  | **Done** | **Observability path**                           | The gateway **records** metrics for upstream outcomes because **Go plugins are not portable** on **Windows**. Persistence is **SQLite** under `data/gateway/` (§3.6); `make clean-data` removes it. Operators can inspect rollups and recent events via **admin** `/ui/metrics` (JSON `/api/ui/metrics`) and the desktop shell **Stats** tab. `config/provider-model-limits.yaml` (§3.7) is **loaded** and **wired into chat** for pre-flight quota checks (see G5 **Partial**). |


**Operator verification (G1)** — Chimera **desktop** → **admin** → generate routing/fallback: chain included **Ollama** models as expected under free-tier patterns.

**Implementation check (G2–G4)** — **Done.** `handleV1Chat` calls `transform.ApplyToolRouter` (after JSON decode, before routing) so `tools` may be slimmed. Package `internal/transform` implements the contract in §3.1 / §3.5.1. Config: `routing.router_models`, `routing.tool_router.enabled`, `routing.tool_router.confidence_threshold` (see `config/gateway.example.yaml`). Admin: `internal/server/embedui/panel.html` section **Router models (tool slimming)** + `POST /api/ui/routing/router_tooling`. Per-request overrides: headers `X-Chimera-Tool-Router: skip` and `X-Chimera-Tool-Confidence-Threshold` (see panel copy).

**Implementation check (G6)** — **Done** (baseline + operator UI): `internal/gatewaymetrics` opens `data/gateway/metrics.sqlite` (paths from `metrics.*` in `chimera.yaml` — `docs/configuration.md`). `porcelain/migrations/chimera-gateway/metrics/*.sql` apply **only at process start** (§3.6.2). `internal/chat` records **one event per upstream HTTP outcome** (provider prefix, full model id, status, **tiktoken `cl100k_base`** estimate of the **proxied JSON body**). Tables: `upstream_call_events`, `upstream_rollup_minute` / `upstream_rollup_day` (UTC minute / UTC day per status). `internal/gatewaymetrics/query.go` exposes rollups + recent events for `internal/server/ui_metrics.go` (`GET /api/ui/metrics`, session-auth) and `internal/server/embedui/metrics.html`; the desktop `shell.html` includes a **Stats** tab (`/ui/metrics?embed=1`). Failed open → **no** metrics; `Runtime.LimitsGuard()` is **nil** without a store, so **quota YAML does not enforce** until metrics work. **413 cooldown** logic still **not** implemented (separate from quota admission).

**Explicitly out of scope for v0.1.1**

- **Message deduplication** (e.g. duplicate file bodies in context): error-prone; defer (possible future summarizer).
- **RAG transformer behavior beyond a stub** — any real vector/RAG work is **v0.2+**; v0.1.1 may reserve hooks only.

---

## 2. Dependencies and sequencing (what must happen first)

1. **Gateway metrics (G6) for G5** — **G6 is shipped** (SQLite + migrations + chat recording + operator metrics UI per §3.6 and **Implementation check (G6)** above). **Quota admission** ( `provider-model-limits.yaml` + `LimitsGuard()` + chat pre-flight, §3.7.6) **consumes** the same store via `upstream_call_events` windows — **not** a BiFrost **Go plugin**. Remaining **G5** work: **413**-driven **cooldown** / backoff config and classification (§3.3), **not** yet tied to metrics reads.
  - **Ollama patterns (G1)** — **done**; **tool slimming (G2)**, **router config + UI (G3)**, **transformer + tool router (G4)** — **done** in gateway (§3.5.1).
  - **413 handling:** **Virtual** path: **fallback after 413** + per-request **exclude-413-models** — **shipped** in `internal/chat`. **Direct** 413: **no** fallback (unchanged). **Cooldown** timers / cross-request 413 memory still **open**.
2. **Router model available in config** — Tool slimming **requires** a working router model id and a call path (same BiFrost base + key as chat, per decision).
3. **Continue / client** — Tool slimming assumes tools arrive in the JSON `tools` array with **unique `function.name`** fields. Per-request **threshold override** is the header `X-Chimera-Tool-Confidence-Threshold`; `X-Chimera-Tool-Router: skip` disables slimming for one call.

---

## 3. Technical contracts (implement exactly)

### 3.1 Tool slimming (router output)

- **Input to router:** User prompt + context as needed (and optionally merged tool list vs MCP later); **source of truth** for definitions is the request `**tools`** array.
- **Router output (JSON):** array of `{ "name": "<string>", "confidence": <number> }` where `name` matches a tool in the incoming list.
- **Selection:** Keep tools where `confidence >= threshold`.
- **Threshold:** Default `routing.tool_router.confidence_threshold` in `chimera.yaml` (default **0.5**); **optional per-request override** via `X-Chimera-Tool-Confidence-Threshold` (0–1).
- **Failure** (timeout, non-200, invalid JSON, missing names): **do not slim** — pass **all** client `tools` upstream.
- **No** extra chat messages and **no** new routing-policy rules for this step — only mutate `**tools`** on the outbound body.

### 3.2 Ollama + free tier

- Use `**patterns:**` in `config/provider-free-tier.yaml` with existing `**path.Match**` semantics (`internal/providerfreetier/spec.go`). Example: `ollama/*` under `patterns:` (one segment after `ollama/` per `*`; add more patterns if ids are deeper).
- **Policy:** **allow-all-local** — any Ollama model returned by the upstream catalog that matches the pattern is eligible; **no** extra security/ops gate in v0.1.1 beyond normal config hygiene.
- **Ship:** default or documented pattern + short note in operator docs so generate-routing and `GET /v1/models` behave as expected.

### 3.3 413 behavior

- **Virtual Chimera** (policy + `routing.fallback_chain`): on upstream **HTTP 413** (`Request Entity Too Large`), the gateway **records** the outcome in **gateway metrics** (status **413** for that model id), then continues along the **same** fallback chain order as for 429/5xx, using the **unchanged** client JSON body. Any model id that **already returned 413** on that request is **not** invoked again (so duplicate ids in the chain are skipped without a second upstream call). **Not yet implemented:** configurable **cooldown timers**, **last-success vs last-request** clock mode, and **longer backoff** after repeated 413 on a model across requests (tracked for a later iteration).
- **Direct** request with a **concrete** upstream model id: **413 is expected** for that model — **do not** fall back or change model; return the error to the client.
- **Classification:** Prefer parsing response body where needed to distinguish **TPM/quota 413** vs **payload-too-large** semantics (TBD per provider).

### 3.4 Router model config

- `routing.router_models: []` in `chimera.yaml`: **ordered** upstream model ids. The gateway tries **each entry in order** for the scoring call until one returns valid JSON scores; if **all** fail, the client `tools` list is left unchanged (fail-open).
- `routing.tool_router.enabled` (bool): when `true` and `router_models` is non-empty, the tool-router transformer runs on `POST /v1/chat/completions`. When `router_models` is empty, the transformer does not run regardless of this flag. If `enabled` is omitted and `router_models` is non-empty, the effective default is **enabled**.
- `routing.tool_router.confidence_threshold`: **0–1**; tools with **confidence ≥ threshold** are kept.
- **Invocation:** same BiFrost **base URL** and **Bearer API key** as normal chat proxy (`POST /v1/chat/completions` on the router model, **non-streaming**).
- **Admin panel:** list, threshold, enable flag, in-process **last router attempt** (model, RFC3339 time, error string), and **ids not found** in upstream `GET /v1/models` after save.
- **Routing preview / generate:** the same admin flow that builds `routing-policy.yaml` and `routing.fallback_chain` also recomputes `routing.router_models` (up to **8** ids) via `routinggen.OrderRouterModels`: prefer **smaller/faster** models (inverse of fallback “strength” heuristics), add **RPM** and **TPM** bonuses from `config/provider-model-limits.yaml` when loaded, and rank **hosted** slightly above `ollama/` at equal score. `tool_router.enabled` / `confidence_threshold` are **not** changed by generate (only the model list is patched).
- **Skip one request:** client header `X-Chimera-Tool-Router: skip` disables slimming for that call only.

### 3.5 Transformers

- **Pipeline:** runs on `POST /v1/chat/completions` before routing/upstream proxying. v0.1.1 ships **one** transformer (**tool slimming**); order is fixed as **[tool-router] → (existing routing + upstream)**. **Parallel** execution remains a future option for independent transformers (e.g. tool slimming + RAG).
- **Tool slimming transformer:** implements §3.1; code in `internal/transform` (`ApplyToolRouter`).
- **RAG transformer:** **stub only** until v0.2 (no real Qdrant/query behavior required for v0.1.1 ship).
- **MCP mock:** clarify in implementation — **tests** at minimum; optional **dev flag** if useful.

#### 3.5.1 Transformer design: tool-router (evaluation)

**Placement in the request path**

1. Gateway validates the gateway **Bearer** token and parses the JSON body into a generic `map[string]json.RawMessage` (same as today).
2. **Transformer stage:** if tool-router is **effective** (see §3.4), `ApplyToolRouter` may replace `tools` on that map; otherwise the map is unchanged.
3. **Routing stage:** unchanged — virtual `chimera-<semver>` uses routing policy + fallback chain; **direct** model id skips policy pick but still receives the **post-transform** body.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Client JSON body] --> B[ApplyToolRouter]
  B --> C{Routing + upstream}
```

**Effective tool-router** means: `routing.tool_router.enabled` is true, `routing.router_models` is non-empty, the request is not opted out with `X-Chimera-Tool-Router: skip`, and the body contains a non-empty `tools` JSON array of `type: function` tools each with a `function.name`.

**Router call (internal)**

The transformer builds a **new** chat-completions request (not visible to the original client):

| Message role | Content |
| -------------- | -------- |
| **system** | Instructs the model to act as a **tool-router**: given the **full `tools` JSON** and the **user’s most recent user-role message**, output **only JSON** scoring **each** tool `name` with `confidence` in **[0, 1]** — how likely the **upstream** model will **need** that tool **on this turn**. Allowed shapes: a JSON **array** `[{"name":"…","confidence":…}, …]` or an object `{"tools":[…]}`. |
| **user** | Concatenates a short label, the **stringified `tools` array** from the client body, and the **extracted user text** (last `role: user` message in `messages`; if `content` is not a plain string, a compact JSON/text representation is used). |

The gateway POSTs that payload to `{upstream.base_url}/v1/chat/completions` with `stream: false`, `temperature: 0`, and `model` set to each `router_models` entry **in order** until a response yields parseable scores.

**Parsing and selection**

- The assistant `message.content` is trimmed; optional **``` / ```json** fences are stripped, then JSON is parsed as either the **array** form or the `{tools:[…]}` wrapper.
- For each original tool, `confidence` is read by `function.name`. If a **name** is **missing** from the router output, that tool is **kept** (conservative default).
- **Threshold:** keep tools with `confidence ≥ threshold` (threshold from config, optionally overridden per request via `X-Chimera-Tool-Confidence-Threshold`).
- If **no** tool would remain (all below threshold), the gateway **does not slim** — it passes **all** tools upstream (same fail-open spirit as a bad router response).
- **Failure** (transport error, non-2xx, invalid JSON, empty scores, or all router models exhausted): **do not slim** — pass **all** client `tools`.

**Side effects and metrics**

- Router calls are **not** mixed into `LimitsGuard` admission or **gateway metrics** SQLite counts in v0.1.1 (only the main proxied completion is metered as today). The admin UI records **last attempt** (model, UTC time, short error) **in memory** for the running process.
- Router HTTP timeout is capped (implementation: **min 5s, max 60s**, derived from `health.chat_timeout_ms`).

### 3.6 Gateway metrics (SQLite, migrations, aggregates)

**Purpose:** Persist enough **upstream-facing** signal for **G5** (413 / TPM cooldown) and operator visibility, without relying on BiFrost Go plugins.

#### 3.6.1 On-disk layout

- **Directory:** `data/gateway/` (same `data/` convention as `data/bifrost/`, `data/qdrant/`).
- **Database file:** e.g. `data/gateway/metrics.sqlite` (exact filename is an implementation detail; keep a single primary DB file in that directory unless split is justified later).
- `make clean-data` (with `CONFIRM=1`) **must** remove `data/gateway/` alongside BiFrost, Qdrant, and `data/locus-desktop/` launcher state so operators get a consistent “empty local stack” story.

#### 3.6.2 Migrations (file-based, not DDL in Go)

- **Authoring rule:** Schema changes live in **committed SQL migration files** under a gateway-owned migrations directory (e.g. `porcelain/migrations/chimera-gateway/metrics/`). **Do not** define migrations as string literals or ad-hoc `Exec` of DDL scattered in application code — only a small **runner** in Go (open DB, apply pending files in order, record version).
- **Acceptable:** The runner may use `//go:embed` **only** to bundle those same committed `.sql` files for single-binary convenience, as long as the **source of truth** remains the filesystem paths in the repo (reviewable diffs, no hand-written DDL in `.go`).
- **Startup behavior:** On gateway **process start**, before accepting traffic that depends on metrics: if the DB file is **missing**, **create** it and apply **all** migrations through **latest**. If the DB exists, run **only pending** migrations through **latest**.
- **No hot migration:** While the process is **live**, **do not** poll the filesystem for new migration files, **do not** re-run the migrator on a timer, and **do not** treat “DB deleted / tables missing / schema behind” as a signal to auto-heal in place. If the file disappears or is corrupted at runtime, **log clearly** and **disable or degrade** metrics recording for that process lifetime (or exit, if the product prefers fail-hard — pick one behavior in implementation and test it). **Operator fix:** restart after restoring or wiping `data/gateway/`; migration runs again on **next** startup. (This matches common embedded-SQLite practice and avoids surprising mid-flight schema locks.)

#### 3.6.3 What to record (upstream contract)

For each relevant **upstream** round-trip (at minimum the BiFrost proxy path used for chat completions; extend if other routes should count):

| Dimension | Requirement |
| --------- | ----------- |
| **Model** | Resolved upstream model id (same string used for routing / catalog alignment). |
| **Provider** | Provider key or stable provider id used by the gateway (consistent with config and logs). |
| **Estimated token count** | Best-effort estimate for the **request** (and optionally **response** if cheap — document which is stored); used for TPM-style reasoning. Exact estimator is implementation-defined but must be **documented** (e.g. heuristic vs tokenizer). |
| **Response from upstream** | For metrics, treat this as the **HTTP result**: **status code** (200, 400, 413, 500, 503, 504, …). **Do not** persist full response bodies by default (size, privacy). Optional tiny **error snippet** for ops is **out of scope** for v0.1.1 unless required for **G5** classification. |

#### 3.6.4 Rollups and reporting (model + provider)

The store must support **counts keyed by (model, provider)** for the **current calendar minute** and **current calendar day**:

- **Calls** — count of upstream attempts (define whether retries increment once vs per attempt; document; prefer **per upstream HTTP response** for G5 alignment).
- **Estimated tokens** — sum of stored estimates for the same windows (same definition as §3.6.3).
- **Response codes** — counts **per status code** within the same **minute** and **day** buckets (e.g. how many 200 vs 413 vs 503 in the current minute and current day).

**Time bucketing:** Use explicit **UTC** for **calendar minute** buckets (RPM/TPM alignment) unless the implementation documents a sliding minute window. **Calendar day** for **generic** metrics rollups may remain UTC for simplicity; for **RPD/TPD enforcement** vs configured caps, **day bucket keys must follow §3.7** (`usage_day_timezone` per provider — e.g. UTC for Groq, `America/Los_Angeles` for Pacific-reset vendors). “Current minute” in UI means the UTC minute bucket containing “now” unless documented otherwise. Keep **minute** vs **vendor-local day** semantics explicit in code and tests.

**Implementation shape:** Either **append-only events** plus indexed queries / materialized rollups, or **mutable counter rows** per `(provider, model, bucket, status)` updated on each response — choose for simplicity and testability; tests must assert correct bucket boundaries and status breakdowns.

### 3.7 Provider / model limits (`config/provider-model-limits.yaml`)

**Purpose:** Declare **vendor quota ceilings** (RPM, RPD, TPM, TPD) and **when a provider’s day resets** for day-scoped limits. This file feeds **admission / guards** (separate from `config/routing-policy.yaml`, which expresses request-shape **preferences**). Limits are **not** returned by BiFrost; operators maintain them (or ship defaults / generated snapshots).

#### 3.7.1 File and wiring

- **Path:** `config/provider-model-limits.yaml` (committed or operator-maintained; optional `config/provider-model-limits.example.yaml` in repo for documentation parity with other config).
- **Gateway:** Load path from `paths.provider_model_limits` in `chimera.yaml` (default `./provider-model-limits.yaml` next to the gateway config file). **Validate** limits YAML on load (**unknown fields rejected**; invalid file → empty spec + log, process continues).

#### 3.7.2 Merge semantics (more specific wins)

Limits are resolved for each upstream id `provider/model` (same string family as routing and metrics).

1. **Global defaults** — optional top-level block (e.g. `defaults:`) with any of `rpm`, `rpd`, `tpm`, `tpd`. Omitted or `null` means **no limit** for that dimension at that layer (until a more specific layer sets a value).
2. **Provider** — under e.g. `providers.<provider_key>:` set limits and **day reset** (see §3.7.3). Provider values **override** global defaults for each field present (non-null).
3. **Provider + model** — under e.g. `providers.<provider_key>.models["provider/model"]:` (or equivalent map keying full model id). Per-model values **override** provider (and global) for each field present.

**Rule:** For each numeric limit field, **the most specific non-null value wins** (`model` > `provider` > `global`). If all are absent/null for a dimension, **do not enforce** that dimension for that model.

#### 3.7.3 Provider day reset (timezone)

- Each **provider** entry **must** be able to declare how **calendar day** is defined for **RPD** and **TPD** (vendors differ: e.g. Groq **UTC**, Gemini **Pacific**).
- Express as an **IANA timezone name** (recommended), e.g. `usage_day_timezone: UTC` or `usage_day_timezone: America/Los_Angeles`. Use IANA so **DST** is handled consistently when computing “today’s” local date for bucketing.
- **Inheritance:** If only global defaults exist, define a **default** `usage_day_timezone` at global level or require every `providers.*` block to set it — pick one and validate (fail startup if a provider with RPD/TPD set lacks a timezone).

#### 3.7.4 Example shape (illustrative; exact field names may match implementation)

```yaml
schema_version: 1

defaults:
  rpm: null
  rpd: null
  tpm: null
  tpd: null

providers:
  groq:
    usage_day_timezone: UTC
    rpm: 30
    rpd: 14400
    tpm: 6000
    tpd: null
    models:
      groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile:
        tpm: 12000
  google:
    usage_day_timezone: America/Los_Angeles
    rpm: null
    rpd: null
    tpm: null
    tpd: null
    models: {}
```

#### 3.7.5 Interaction with metrics (G6) and guards

- **Usage** (SQLite rollups / events) is compared to **effective limits** from this file when deciding skip / reorder / cooldown.
- **Same estimator** for TPM/TPD as documented in §3.6.3 unless explicitly documented otherwise.

#### 3.7.6 Implementation check (G5 – limits + chat admission) — **Done (quota path); 413 cooldown open**

The loader, resolver, admission primitives, and **chat-path wiring** are shipped: `internal/chat` calls `Runtime.LimitsGuard()` before each upstream attempt (virtual fallback and direct model). Denied candidates are **skipped** in the fallback loop; the last candidate denied by quotas returns **HTTP 429** with `type: gateway_provider_limits`. Direct requests return the same **429** shape when the sole model would exceed limits. **413 cooldown** (§3.5) remains a separate follow-up.

- **Package `internal/providerlimits`:**
  - `Parse` / `Load` / `LoadOrEmpty` read `provider-model-limits.yaml` with **unknown fields rejected** (`yaml.KnownFields(true)`). An empty or missing file yields an empty `Config` (no enforcement). Invalid files fail startup loading; a bad file logged by the gateway falls back to an empty spec so the process still runs.
  - **Merge semantics match §3.7.2:** `Config.Resolve(upstreamID)` layers `defaults` → `providers.<p>` → `providers.<p>.models.<p/m>`; the most specific **non-nil** value wins per dimension. Model keys **must** start with `"<provider>/"`; mismatched prefixes are rejected.
  - **Day reset (§3.7.3):** `usage_day_timezone` is an IANA name validated via `time.LoadLocation`. A provider that sets `rpd`/`tpd` (or any of its models does) must resolve a tz from its own block or `defaults`; startup fails otherwise.
  - **Time math:** `MinuteKey` returns UTC minute keys (RPM/TPM are UTC-aligned in the metrics schema). `DayKey(at, tz)` returns the calendar-day string for an instant in `tz`. `DayWindow(at, tz)` returns the `[startUTC, endUTC)` bounds of the local day (DST-safe — tested across the PDT spring-forward).
  - **Admission:** Pure `Decide(Effective, Usage, estForThisRequest)` returns an `Allowed`/`Reason{rpm|rpd|tpm|tpd}` decision. `Guard{Cfg, Usage, Now}` composes a `Config` with a `UsageSource` (usage query by time window) and performs the minute / vendor-local-day lookups, then calls `Decide`. On query errors the guard **degrades to allow** (propagating the error for logging) — the gateway must not refuse traffic when metrics are unreadable.
- **Metrics query helper (`internal/gatewaymetrics`):** `Store.UsageForModelWindow(ctx, modelID, start, end)` sums `(count, SUM(est_tokens))` from `upstream_call_events` across all statuses in `[start, end)`. This is what `Guard` uses for both minute and vendor-local-day windows and is covered by `usage_test.go`.
- **Config / Runtime:** `chimera.yaml` accepts `paths.provider_model_limits` (default `./provider-model-limits.yaml` relative to `chimera.yaml`). `config.Resolved.ProviderLimitsPath` + `.ProviderLimitsSpec` are populated on every load (non-nil — empty when the file is missing). `Runtime.LimitsGuard()` returns a ready guard composed of the spec and metrics store, or `nil` when either is unavailable (callers treat `nil` as "no enforcement"). A thin `metricsUsageAdapter` in `internal/server/runtime.go` bridges the SQLite store to `providerlimits.UsageSource` so the limits package does not depend on the SQLite driver.
- **Tests:** Parser (defaults, per-provider, per-model, unknown fields, negative numbers, bad tz, tz-required-for-day-limits, model key prefix rule, missing file), resolver (layering, unknown provider, tz pruning when no day limits), day/minute key math (UTC vs PT + DST spring-forward), `Decide` priority (minute before day, each dimension), `Guard` with fake usage source (RPM deny, vendor-local RPD deny across UTC/PT boundary, error-degrades-to-allow, headroom allows), metrics `UsageForModelWindow`, config loader (default path, sibling file parsing), and `internal/chat/chat_limits_test.go` (direct **429** before upstream; fallback skips exhausted model; all denied → **429**).
- **Still open (tracked):** wiring limit / 413 signals into **cooldown** and richer operator surfacing (§3.5 / G5); chat skip + **429** on exhaustion is **done** (see `internal/chat/chat.go`, `internal/chat/chat_limits_test.go`).

## 4. Where work likely lands (codebase map)

Agents should confirm paths with the repo; starting points:


| Area                                | Likely locations                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Free-tier / patterns                | `internal/providerfreetier/`, `config/provider-free-tier.yaml`, `internal/server/ui_routing_generate.go`, routing gen                                                                |
| Chat proxy + retries                | `internal/chat/chat.go` (e.g. `retryStatuses`), `internal/server/` handlers for `/v1/chat/completions`                                                                               |
| 413 / TPM metrics + cooldown inputs | **Quota:** `internal/gatewaymetrics` + `internal/providerlimits` + chat (§3.7.6). **Virtual 413 → next fallback:** `internal/chat` `WithVirtualModelFallback` (§3.3). **413 cooldown** (timers / cross-request): still **open** |
| SQLite metrics + migrations | **Shipped:** `internal/gatewaymetrics/` (`Open`, `ApplyMigrations`, `RecordUpstreamResponse`, `QueryMinuteRollups` / `QueryDayRollups` / `QueryRecentEvents`, `UsageForModelWindow`); `porcelain/migrations/chimera-gateway/metrics/*.sql`; `chimera.yaml` → `data/gateway/metrics.sqlite`; `internal/server/ui_metrics.go`, `embedui/metrics.html`, `/ui/metrics` + `/api/ui/metrics` |
| Provider/model limits               | **Shipped:** `internal/providerlimits/` + `internal/chat` (`LimitsGuard()` before upstream; `chat_limits_test.go`); `paths.provider_model_limits` in `config.LoadGatewayYAML` → `Runtime.LimitsGuard()`; `config/provider-model-limits.yaml` (+ `.example.yaml`) |
| Config load / validation            | `internal/config/config.go`, `docs/configuration.md` (`metrics.*`, `paths.provider_model_limits`)                                                                                                                       |
| Transformers                        | `internal/transform` (`ApplyToolRouter`); `handleV1Chat` runs it before routing/upstream                                                                                      |
| Router calls                        | Same `POST /v1/chat/completions` surface as chat; ordered `router_models` with fail-open to full `tools`                                                                   |
| Desktop admin                       | Webview shell `embedui/shell.html` (tabs include **Stats** → `/ui/metrics`); routing generate and other admin paths as before                                                                                                                    |

## 5. Verification (agents must satisfy)

- **Unit / integration tests** for: `internal/transform` (parse scores, threshold filter, fail-open); policy `Match` / `Filter` with `ollama/*`; **virtual 413 fallback + metrics** — `internal/chat/chat_limits_test.go` (`TestWithVirtualModelFallback_413_*`). **Direct** 413 unchanged (no test required here). **Metrics (G6):** `internal/gatewaymetrics` migration + rollup + `usage_test` + query tests; `internal/chat` metrics test + `chat_limits_test` (quota deny / skip / all **429**). **Limits:** `internal/providerlimits` tests (parse/merge, **RPD/TPD** day-key across zones + DST); `internal/config` limits path tests + gateway patch tests for `router_models`. **Future:** no migrator mid-run test (§3.6.2) when desired; optional **HTTP-level** tests for router slimming against a fake upstream.
- **Config:** `docs/configuration.md` documents `metrics.*`, `paths.provider_model_limits`, and `provider-model-limits.yaml`. `config/gateway.example.yaml` includes `provider_model_limits` and **`routing.router_models` / `routing.tool_router`**. Still document `router_models` in `docs/configuration.md` when that file is next edited; **413** cooldown clock mode when **G5** 413 path ships.
- **Manual:** Operator can add `patterns: ["ollama/*"]`, regenerate routing, and see Ollama ids in fallback; Continue chat with large `tools` shows reduced upstream size in logs (if logged) or smaller TPM failures.
