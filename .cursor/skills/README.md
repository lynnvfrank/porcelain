|-------|---------|
| [harness-plan-delivery](harness-plan-delivery/SKILL.md) | Mark a `virtual-model-harness-*` plan done (`make precommit`, hard cut, docs) |
| [harness-stage-implementer](harness-stage-implementer/SKILL.md) | Add/extend `internal/harness` stages |
| [harness-gallery-fixtures](harness-gallery-fixtures/SKILL.md) | Multi-state `/ui/settings/gallery` samples |
| [harness-ui-design-validator](harness-ui-design-validator/SKILL.md) | UI look-and-feel + gallery review |
